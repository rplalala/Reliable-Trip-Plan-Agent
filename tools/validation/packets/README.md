# Historical development packets

These tracked launchers, fixed request inputs and offline tests were relocated from
the former scratch tracker. Existing per-run dates and budgets are historical.
Execution requires a separately authorized plan and the smoke-test coordination
workflow in AGENTS.md. Relocation does not authorize reruns or refresh frozen hashes.

Landmark and focus tools use the fixed inputs under preference-landmark-balance/pilot.
Run the packet tests offline with pytest `--import-mode=importlib` because historical
directories share test filenames. Diagnosis/audit tools additionally require the
original ignored local evidence identified in their source; fresh clones contain
the tools and synthetic inputs, not private runtime logs or provider payloads.
