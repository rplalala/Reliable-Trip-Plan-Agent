# Independent evaluation architecture

Status: Tickets 01-12 have offline implementations within their approved scopes.
This is a technical boundary, not a formal benchmark or results report.
[PROJECT.md](../PROJECT.md) and live Issues own current authorization and task state.

## Separation from planning and benchmark construction

The final-quality workflow consumes a deliberately submitted, curated, source-linked batch. It does
not run planners, choose replacement cases, monitor a growing case list or decide when
benchmark construction is complete. The producer/user owns batch selection and eligibility.
Planner caches, validator verdicts and repair-target disappearance are not independent
factual ground truth. Independent observations retain provider/time/query applicability.

Input identity and artifact hashes preserve exact provenance. Original result bytes are
not rewritten to improve scores. Version-neutral projection separates visits, protections,
references and transport, preserving uncertainty and source references. V0 transport comes
from model transport activities; V1-V3 transport comes from application transfers. Ignored
sources retain diagnostics but contribute no fallback transport occupancy.

## Implemented module boundaries

| Slice | Implemented responsibility | Detailed reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01-04 | Intake/projection, opt-in usage reporting, identity/adjudication, injected snapshot acquisition and replay | [Intake/identity/usage](contracts/0002-intake-identity-usage.md) |
| 05 | Requirement and schedule metrics with independent time/occupancy review | [Requirement/schedule](contracts/0003-requirement-schedule.md) |
| 06-07 | Offline opening and route preparation/scoring | [Opening/routes](contracts/0004-opening-routes.md) |
| 08-09 | Quality report, anonymous review package, answer import and descriptive outcomes | [Quality/human review](contracts/0005-quality-human-review.md) |
| 10 | Source-driven V3 draft/final-primary preparation, paired masks/deltas and independent continuity | [V3 paired diagnostic](contracts/0005-quality-human-review.md#v3-pairs) |
| 11 | Isolated frozen real V3 post-primary execution and independently reviewed target/control outcomes | [Controlled Repair](contracts/0001-evaluation-artifacts.md#controlled-repair) |
| 12 | Selected-source mechanism reports, exact official-claim audit queue/reviews and default-off local submission/selection capture | [Mechanism/audit](contracts/0001-evaluation-artifacts.md#mechanism-official-audit) |

[Artifacts and evidence contracts](contracts/0001-evaluation-artifacts.md) define shared
material integrity, source roles and independent evidence/time semantics. The five topic
contracts state current rules continuously, including ordinary-output compatibility. Historical
proposals and approvals remain in linked records/Issues. Broad proposals do not imply that
unimplemented follow-up modules are available.

Snapshot acquisition accepts injected transport. The evaluator-owned
`evaluation_run.prepare_run / execute_run / replay_run` and
[formal CLI](../backend/evaluation/README.md#fresh-automatic-evaluation-cli) now compose
fresh Google acquisition, V0-only correspondence and all native automatic final-quality
consumers. Preparation freezes originals, contexts, limits, prices and code; execution
persists evidence/failures; replay sends nothing. Final-only scope explicitly excludes
optional V3 and human/controlled/official tracks. Processing, acquisition and unresolved
evidence are separate fields. Fresh execution requires a prepared, approved allowance.

The [opening/route contract](contracts/0004-opening-routes.md) owns schedule precedence,
missing-hours access assessments and snapshot-coordinate reuse. Model-supported access PASS
remains distinct from verified API hours. Dated execution outcomes are in
[acceptance records](records/README.md), rather than this current module map.

Development smoke helpers are separate from ordinary evaluator consumers. The
[V0 route request preparer](../backend/evaluation/tools/route_requests.py) and its CLI
live under `backend/evaluation/tools/`; they prepare acquisition inventories and budgets
for explicitly approved development checks. They are not product runtime stages or
dependencies of final quality scoring. Core intake, independent identity, snapshot,
schedule/opening/route scorers and report CLIs stay in `backend/evaluation/`. Product
planning does not import this evaluation package. V3's internal validation/repair remains
part of planning and is distinct from independent evaluation.

## Scoring semantics and uncertainty

[Version-specific identity](contracts/0002-intake-identity-usage.md#version-specific-identity-requirement)
uses V0-only model correspondence and V1-V3 independent API/program checks, with explicit
historical replay. Grounding assesses original claims; a separately verified physical
association can support occurrence matching, opening and routes while grounding FAIL stays
visible. [Requirement count bounds](contracts/0003-requirement-schedule.md#count-bounds-and-completeness)
define fulfillment; recognizing a venue never establishes every requirement component.
[Missing-hours access assessment](contracts/0004-opening-routes.md#missing-hours-access-judgment)
is a separate opening-only model exception.

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Submitted group | One request and its source-linked selected version artifacts; inclusion is not proof of quality |
| Claim | A proposition represented in the submitted output or reviewed obligation |
| Independent observation | Separately sourced evidence with declared identity/query/time applicability |
| Physical association | Verified API venue usable for occurrence matching, hours and coordinates while preserving original grounding and version-owned requirement targets |
| Identity judgment | Version-scoped program checks or V0 model correspondence with independent API facts, preserving original claims and uncertainty |
| Historical adjudication | Human resolution in an explicitly replayed legacy identity report |
| Compliance | Outcome against an applicable criterion, distinct from evidence availability |
| Access reasonableness | Fallible independent model assessment of the original activity and complete visit window when both API schedules are absent; PASS does not establish factual hours |
| Common mask | The explicitly shared comparison set; missing evidence must remain visible |
| UNKNOWN | An unresolved applicable fact/outcome, not a passing check or a zero-valued measurement |
| Blinded review | Human preference judgment without exposing version attribution or automatic scores |

Explicit obligations retain exact counts, dates and subjects. Same-scope overlapping protected
intervals share occupancy blocking while each original obligation is checked independently.
Protections are not additional non-overlap score units. Unstated named-visit counts do not
silently authorize repeated visits; explicit repetition permission has separate semantics.

Opening/route checks distinguish decisive independently supported FAIL from complete PASS
and unresolved evidence. Coverage, availability, denominators and burden remain visible.
Quality reports use exact shared-mask arithmetic; uncertainty must not disappear by shrinking
a denominator or treating unavailable dimensions as zero. Fees/access and absent facts are
not certified by structural schema acceptance.

Anonymous review is separate from automatic scoring. The researcher prepares source-linked
display material, holds the hidden mapping and imports revision-aware answers. The renderer
uses IANA time-zone selection and HH:mm, with confirmed clearing scoped to the active package
and rater. User-reported browser acceptance is distinct from automated test evidence.

## Paired, controlled and mechanism boundaries

Ticket 10's offline preparation/report uses validated existing activity/adopted-edit/split
lineage before content fallback and residual review. It preserves valid paired aggregate
scores despite unresolved local correspondence, while venue identity and quality remain
independent of producer decisions. Its two-stage mask is separate from the four-final mask.
See the [development acceptance](records/evaluation/v3-pair-report.md).
Controlled Repair is the isolated Ticket 11 execution boundary. Ticket 12 reads selected
saved sources and optionally captured actual observations. Internal acceptance, independent
quality and independent official-fact review remain separate. Capture adds no model/provider
calls or tokens by design; its local normalization/storage overhead is unmeasured. Missing
historical observations cannot be inferred from final outputs or current gate replay.
This document authorizes no formal run, comparison or final conclusion.

The [controlled replay contract](contracts/0001-evaluation-artifacts.md#controlled-repair)
owns frozen real V3 execution, control invariants and independently reviewed outcomes.
The [mechanism/audit contract](contracts/0001-evaluation-artifacts.md#mechanism-official-audit)
owns observation units and actual submission/selection capture. Neither creates a formal
corpus or proves causal improvement.

Commands, installed task groups, explicit options and one-use execution are documented in
the [evaluation package guide](../backend/evaluation/README.md). Optional preparation/replay
remain offline. No implicit supplemental assessment or retry is added. See
[ADR: evaluation independence](adr/0004-independent-evaluation.md).

## Batch and benchmark terminology

**Qualifying group**: One request and the four V0-V3 outputs whose respective workflow completion has been established by benchmark construction. Qualification is not a claim of itinerary quality.

**Benchmark candidate list**: The collection of qualifying groups available for later user selection. Adding a candidate does not initiate evaluation.

**Evaluation batch**: The explicitly selected collection of groups handed over by the user for evaluation. Its size is not fixed by the evaluation module.

**Requirement Specification**: Independently authored and reviewed obligations from the
complete original request, separate from planner interpretation. The native artifact
records review provenance; the installed material handoff uses separately operated
external author/reviewer agents, which must not be described as human review. See the
[requirement ownership contract](contracts/0003-requirement-schedule.md#rtpeval-requirement-spec-contract).

**Evaluation snapshot**: Preserved independent external evidence used consistently to assess the submitted itineraries. It is an evidence basis, not absolute real-world truth.

## Requirement and schedule units

**Submitted place claim**: The scheduled place identified by the output's structured
place fields, independently checked against external evidence. A descriptive title does
not need to be synonymous with that name; the claim does not itself establish factual identity.

**Transport association**: The source-linked relation between a submitted journey and
a directed pair of scheduled visit occurrences. It does not establish route feasibility.

**Obligation check**: One outcome for one independently reviewed requirement, with
all of its explicit count, date and time conditions retained as components.

**Schedule commitment**: One distinct scheduled visit, journey or fixed activity whose
occupied time is assessed independently; uncertain timing does not erase the commitment.

**Daily density deduction**: A reviewed ordinary/relaxed/rich pace policy applied to
source-distinct primary visit counts on every requested date. Explicit matching daily
numbers override defaults. This deduction adjusts the overall score while preserving
the original five-dimensional auxiliary score; [the score contract](contracts/0005-quality-human-review.md#daily-density)
owns numeric penalties, review provenance and uncertainty rules.

**Protected blocker**: A reviewed interval restricting specified kinds of scheduled
commitments. Overlapping protections can share a blocked span while remaining separate
user obligations.

**Potential match**: A source-preserved occurrence whose unresolved role or identity
could affect a reviewed place obligation; it is not a confirmed visit to that place.

## Route evaluation concepts

**Route candidate leg**: A directed connection between consecutive scheduled primary
visit occurrences on one delivered day. It remains inventoried when route evidence is
missing or applicability is uncertain.

**Submitted departure**: The departure claimed by the itinerary's authoritative
transport representation. It is distinct from the departure used for an evidence query.

**Query departure**: The departure recorded in the independent route request; omission
is a distinct time basis rather than proof that the submitted departure was queried.

**Continuous travel interval**: One uninterrupted available span for a candidate journey.
Separate spans around an occupied commitment do not form one longer interval.

**Route cap**: An adopted per-mode provider duration or distance threshold. It is
separate from the available time between scheduled commitments.

**Hard route deadline**: An applicable non-travel protection or guaranteed fixed
occupation boundary that permits no schedule grace, including the DRIVE reserve.

**Decisive route verdict**: A combined outcome established by all required PASS components
or any independently proven FAIL. A partial decisive FAIL does not establish complete
component evidence; missing components remain separately visible.

## V3 before/after concepts

**V3 stage pair**: The selected V3 run's pre-repair draft and final primary itinerary,
evaluated independently under one compatible frozen snapshot. The draft is a V3 stage,
not an independently executed V2 itinerary.

**Paired dimension mask**: The common included score dimensions for a V3 stage pair;
a dimension is omitted only when neither stage has applicable or unresolved units.
It is separate from the four-version final report's mask.

**Edit provenance**: Source-linked evidence of transformations actually adopted between
V3 stages, including retained activity IDs and parent/fragment relations. It describes
editing history without establishing independent quality or venue identity.

**Occurrence correspondence**: A validated relation between activities in the two V3
stages, established first through edit provenance and then through source-content or
reviewed evidence where needed. Edit continuity is distinct from venue continuity.

**Correspondence review**: Source-linked human verification of an ambiguous or complex
cross-stage relation remaining after provenance validation and content fallback. Complexity
alone does not require review when validated sources establish the relation; independent
quality checks determine compliance.

## Blinded ranking concepts

**Anonymous plan label**: A public A/B/C/D identifier whose plan association remains
fixed across the three ranking dimensions within one assessment task.

**Private label mapping**: The researcher-only association between anonymous labels
and selected source versions, retained outside the rater package and answer export.

**Display preparation**: Researcher review of prospective anonymous content, including
source-linked removal of identity/provenance identifiers while preserving travel facts
and uncertainty. It is separate from the rater's assessment.

**Tie group**: A set of plan labels judged equally for one dimension. Ordered tie
groups in a submitted ranking partition all four labels exactly once.

**Unable-to-judge response**: A whole-dimension response indicating insufficient basis
to rank the plans. It does not mean the plans are tied or that the dimension is inapplicable.

**Not-applicable response**: A whole-dimension response indicating that the dimension
does not apply to this task. It does not supply an ordering.

**Effective answer revision**: The highest valid complete submitted revision for one
task/rater. Earlier revisions remain audit records; drafts are not effective answers.

**Inferred display arrival**: A separately labelled clock time computed from supplied
departure and duration when the itinerary omits arrival. It is not a submitted arrival
claim, independent evidence or an input to quality scoring.

**Hidden duplicate task**: A repeated source group presented under an independent
anonymous assignment, used for within-rater consistency and excluded from main counts.

**Comparable pair**: A version pair with a ranked outcome in both an original task and
its hidden duplicate for the same dimension. No comparable pairs means consistency
is unavailable, not perfect agreement.
