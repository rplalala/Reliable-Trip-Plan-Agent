# Semantic Reference Correction

This history follows reference failures, bounded correction, short-reference adoption
and adapter validation. Current rules are in [model identity references](../../0001-system-architecture.md#model-identity-references)
and [semantic qualification](../../0002-requirements-evidence.md#semantic-qualification-and-multiplicity).
Historical replay assertions describe their recorded revision and grant no execution permission.

## September 27: failure classes and correction scope

At `339e7e4a4a9eac133f2bdff69217b8b35c6990b4`, the service admitted only complete
validated batches and allowed one citation-only correction. Saved responses under
`logs/semantic_reference_network_revalidation_20260927/<case>/attempt_1/semantics/`
were joined by call_id and replayed at the external-model boundary through the actual
`POISemanticsService.assess`. Repeated replay asserted each historical error, one
call and zero cached rows; single-candidate counterfactuals isolated each defect.
Source input/output remained unchanged. Replay/probe modules live under that evidence
root's `diagnosis/`; their old terminal/count assertions are not current acceptance.

Sydney V1 returned all 32 identities correctly, but ten food-service rows promoted
`semantic_3` to an exception. That continuing favor preference had
`explicit_primary_exception=false`, with no named requirements/application bindings.
The rejection respected the then-approved role contract; it did not prohibit ordinary
food activities. Prompt 3 omitted explicit flag/polarity and REQUIRED-binding conditions.
This supports a prompt-alignment explanation, not proof of internal model reasoning.
Serializer roundtrip equality ruled out loss of the supplied permission flag.
Removing claims or changing those rows to non_main passed counterfactual validation;
neither justified silent production stripping or endorsed all semantic judgments.

Sydney V3 and Melbourne V1 each returned 32 unique rows but corrupted one canonical ID:

- El Camino Cantina: `ChIJk8CcRwivEmsROPWHqq2Qlv0` became
  `ChIJk8CcRwivEmsROPWHqq2Qlv2`.
- Chinatown: `ChIJczgQh8lC1moR9r9gP44FRvY` became
  `ChIJczgQh8lC1moR9r9gP44FRvN`.

Both row IDs and match citations changed. Fixing only place_id exposed citation failure;
fixing that ID and its citations passed the original batch. Schema-valid arbitrary strings
are not batch membership checks. Input roundtrips matched; no service remapping defect was
found. Identity-set/unauthorized-exception errors were then terminal, so these runs did
not exercise or demonstrate regression of the citation correction. All used only 1/6
calls, roughly 20–26/120 seconds and under 8192 output tokens without timeout/truncation.
Raising budgets alone could not enter a branch excluded by error type.

The approved minimum extension kept strict validation and one shared correction per
batch across identity, citation and exception-authorization/ownership failures.
Bounded feedback supplied missing/unexpected/duplicate identities and affected requirement
conditions; whole-batch validation preceded atomic admission. Prompt 4 made favor plus
explicit permission or exact REQUIRED named binding explicit. Fuzzy matching, row-order
identity inference, partial admission and a separate retry per error class were rejected.
V0, acquisition capacities and quantity Repair remained outside the extension.

Revalidation used Sydney V1/V3 and Melbourne V1 once each, with original two-traveler
AUD 3000 inputs from `logs/live_smoke_20260926/`. Sydney ran September 28–October 2;
Melbourne ended October 5. The frozen prompt-4 change passed 1712 backend tests with
9 skips, then 72 focused tests and both reviews. These are offline checks, not proof
of live efficacy. Historical limits were 600 seconds/application, 660 outer; semantic
6 calls, 120 seconds total, 45/call, 32000 input/8192 output, at most two calls per batch.
Capture ceilings were 1 MiB/stage and 4 MiB/case with raw envelopes disabled.
First-call success did not exercise correction; downstream failure did not complete
itinerary acceptance. Original dates expired September 29 and must not be backdated.

## September 27: short references chosen over a second correction

In `logs/semantic_contract_revalidation_20260927`, Sydney V1 first corrupted an ID's
last character (4→5). Its second output repaired identity coverage but introduced
`7f` into a supported-match citation whose first version had been correct. The two
calls consumed 49.918/120 seconds, neither reaching 45 seconds. The batch attempt
ceiling, rather than the request-wide budget, prevented a third call.

Option A proposed a second correction (three total batch attempts), retaining global
6-call/time/token limits. A third whole-batch regeneration might correct or introduce
errors; no success probability was measured. Observed 32-row calls took 20–26 seconds,
about 4.1–4.7k input and 4.4–6.4k output tokens. A similar third call might bring the
phase to roughly 70–76 seconds, reducing later capacity; billed cost was unavailable.

Option B used predeclared bijective batch-local `pNN`/`eNN` mappings, stable across
corrections. Exact complete candidate coverage and same-candidate source ownership
preceded canonical restoration and existing semantic checks. The user later chose B,
retaining the existing one-correction and global budgets. Wire/domain DTO separation,
projection version in cache fingerprints, input accounting and bounded mapping/wire/
resolved capture were necessary; dynamic enums, extra retries and partial-row repair
were not part of this minimum implementation.

The offline o200k measurement below changed only exact known ID/source strings in
compact sorted JSON. Malformed strings stayed unchanged; schema/prompt/framing and
mapping-capture overhead were excluded. This was a serialization counterfactual,
not a model invocation, billed usage, latency or accuracy measurement.

| Captured output | Rows | Exact ID/source occurrences | Original input/output JSON tokens | Short input/output JSON tokens |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Sydney V1 initial, failed | 32 | 89 | 2995 / 4169 | 1885 / 2594 |
| Sydney V1 correction, failed | 32 | 89 | 3140 / 4330 | 2011 / 2751 |
| Sydney V3 first batch, accepted | 32 | 81 | 2931 / 3994 | 1819 / 2560 |
| Sydney V3 second batch, accepted | 11 | 28 | 1283 / 1275 | 910 / 788 |
| Melbourne V1, accepted | 32 | 78 | 2942 / 3660 | 1828 / 2282 |

Accepted 32-row outputs shrank 35.9%/37.7% in content tokens, with input about 38%.
This identifies repeated opaque text, not improved model reliability: valid short
references can still be confused. B reduced copying burden without new calls;
A remained a possible lower-effort fallback rather than being proven ineffective.
They were not combined, which preserved interpretability of subsequent smoke evidence.

## September 27: recorded V3 budget reconstruction

Run `1eba61e8-ad9b-48cc-9998-6e5d8392b0af` was audited offline by
`tools/validation/packets/semantic-reference-correction/audit_v3_budget.py`, using
saved result/runtime/execution/events only. Output is
`logs/semantic_short_reference_revalidation_20260927/v3-budget-audit.json`.
Forty-five range checks passed; event sequences 1–212 were continuous with no malformed
JSON lines. Four source fingerprints and per-row locations preserve replay provenance.
Continuity does not prove uninstrumented network behavior. Cumulative/nested snapshots
were not added together; primary, RAG and Repair provider pools remained separate.

| Pool / metric | Recorded use / limit |
|---|---:|
| Primary destination / candidate searches | 1/1; 3/12 |
| Primary Details / weather | 32/60; 1/2 |
| Primary admitted candidates / final POIs at selection | 64/64; 16/20 |
| Primary review Details / experience model calls at selection | 0/8; 0/8 |
| Primary baseline routes / elements | 4/7; 256/400 |
| Primary alternative route calls / unique pairs / elements | 16/32; 11/32; 16/64 |
| Official web tasks / page fetches | 0/8; 0/8 |
| RAG retrieval queries / returned positions | 2/4; 40/80 |
| RAG Details / fallback | 26/30; 4/4 |
| RAG elapsed | 15.400/360 seconds |
| Semantic calls / elapsed | 2/6; 27.412/120 seconds |
| Semantic per-call elapsed | 15.533 and 11.879, each below 45 seconds |
| Semantic engineering input | 5210 and 4493, each below 32000 |
| Semantic reported output | 3270 and 2229, each below 8192 |
| Primary generation engineering input | 65807/252000 |
| Repair rounds / model calls | 1/5; 1/5 |
| Repair routes / elements | 12/24; 12/32 |
| Repair preparation routes | 12/16 (8 of 24 reserved for post-proposal) |
| Repair new Google / fallback / embedding / retrieval / canonical / Details | all 0, within their separate limits |
| Repair engineering input / reported output | 31970/252000; 1166/16384 |
| Nearby requests / elapsed | 3/3; 1.563/10 seconds |
| Application elapsed | 114.860/600 seconds |

One embedding send covered two retrieval queries and reported 7 tokens, not two model
calls. Semantic reported inputs 3023/2306 differ from conservative engineering counts.
RAG fallback reached 4/4 with two `fallback_budget` omissions; Nearby reached 3/3.
Primary pre-generation used 16 route calls, with 16 reserved post-generation. The 96
`alternative_route_matrix_calls` stop reasons are denied work, not 96 sends. Repair's
12 route calls are separate; these are coverage limits, not recorded overruns.

`run.json` had `original_bytes=4908309` against a 1,000,000-byte cap; its 1,090,256-byte
file was a preview wrapper. The event stream remained usable, while `v3_finalized`
was summarized/truncated and final result/individual Repair artifacts survived.
Requirement captures lacked usage and surviving main-generation usage was missing:
complete billed tokens, individual provider latency and monetary total could not be
reconstructed. The 38 null activity costs concern travel budget, not API resources.

The audit proposed a compact independent final budget/usage summary, written before
payload truncation, preserving counters/call IDs and explicit missing status. It was
not implemented by this audit. Raising the cap above 4,908,309 could preserve this run
but move the future cutoff; API/Repair budget changes were not justified by storage loss.

## October 5: cross-chain mapping implementation

The approved audit began at `08b2cc477b779d3b168aa593a64ba4e07a166676`; it extended
reversible references across supplied-ID model boundaries. The earlier V0 pilot
[#63](https://github.com/rplalala/Reliable-Trip-Plan-Agent/issues/63) remained separate;
[#64](https://github.com/rplalala/Reliable-Trip-Plan-Agent/issues/64) records this work.

| Current model boundary | Observation and resulting change |
| --- | --- |
| V0 primary | No supplied external place ID to reproduce. Model-created activity/transport identities retain their existing contract. No external tools added. |
| Shared requirement interpretation | Source quotations and existing short local requirement references; no long-ID round trip found. Unchanged. |
| V1-V3 primary | Full canonical place IDs previously appeared in evidence and returned `source_place_id`. Shared aliases now cover evidence, compact directed routes, identity-based conflicts, official projections and candidate supply. |
| Review profiling | Canonical place ID previously returned alongside already-short `review_N` references. Only the place identity now uses an alias. |
| POI semantic classification | Existing `pNN`/`eNN` projection already protects canonical places and evidence. Unchanged. |
| Landmark nomination | Names and descriptions, with application identity resolution afterwards. No supplied long-ID round trip found. Unchanged. |
| V3 Repair | Full place/activity/target IDs previously had to be copied. Aliases now cover their structured permissions, feedback, route endpoints, temporal fragments, lineage keys/values and compensation permissions. Original patch authorization/adoption remains canonical. |
| Official evidence reasoning | Canonical place IDs and hashed source keys previously returned in assessments. Place, source and task fields now use aliases; original URLs, exact spans and source alignment remain required. |
| Product introductions | Supplied activity IDs previously returned in decoration output. Activity aliases are restored before existing result ownership checks. |
| Preference polishing, native web search, embeddings | No supplied long IDs that the model must repeat; provider-generated citation IDs and vectors are separate. Unchanged. |
| Native evaluator | No operational identity-assistance LLM caller. Added an offline proposal packet using reference/place aliases; no model client, live acquisition, human adjudication or native adoption was added. Controlled Repair continues using its isolated frozen ports. |

A data-only neutral mapping utility derives distinct namespaces from complete per-call
identities without SDK/planner/evaluator-policy dependencies, hash truncation or prose
inference. Exact restoration, nullable response enums and unchanged native permissions
precede acceptance. Evaluator packets enforce decision coverage/per-reference ownership;
primary/Repair sizing includes transmitted aliases, instruction and enum schema under
unchanged ceilings. No new sends or retries were introduced.

| Validation stage | Result and interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| Initial focused / affected | 224 passed; 481 passed plus an obsolete non-JSON Repair SDK fixture failure. |
| Expanded regressions | 654 passed after covering lineage, fragment/related/removable identities and excluding user prompt markers from owned JSON parsing. |
| First full suite | 2682 passed, 10 skipped, two failures: import guard and concurrent frozen-source hash change. |
| Dependency correction | Neutral helper plus JSON-only evaluator packet preserved the guard; 19 related tests passed. Stable-source acceptance passed separately. |
| Actual SDK adapter | 9 MockTransport tests covered constrained request and canonical restoration, without network. |
| Stable final full suite | 2686 passed, 10 skipped, 249.85 seconds; Ruff/diff and independent Standards/Spec reviews passed. |

Implementation commits: `a8b13d1` (planning adapters) and `e9567f6` (offline evaluator
proposal packet). Evidence: `artifacts/short-id-20261005/` focused/affected/full logs
and `v0-identity-{short-input,reference-map,offline-replay}.json`.
All 61 original V0 pilot-authorized file hashes remained unchanged. The packet covered
nine references and twelve distinct candidates, mapping SHA256
`4a7d36cc0e0ccf64138f1faf36a194b99fe606c8999538966b3cc16fbe66a36b`.
Existing proposals restored identically; engineering estimates changed 5017→4522 tokens,
not the old provider's reported 4213 or measured new billing/accuracy.
Native identity adoption remained zero and four V0 routes remained UNKNOWN.

## October 5: six-adapter live regression

[#66](https://github.com/rplalala/Reliable-Trip-Plan-Agent/issues/66) followed the mapping
audit; [#67](https://github.com/rplalala/Reliable-Trip-Plan-Agent/issues/67) owned a
separate Proposed V0 adoption design. The initial plan was preparation only; its
subsequent approval authorized the executor and six selected adapter calls, not full
four-planner orchestration, discovery/RAG/Google or adoption. Prior work was published
through [PR #65](https://github.com/rplalala/Reliable-Trip-Plan-Agent/pull/65), merge
`62f9329903b53f76abb8ea2a37e119bd94d3f478`.

The runner freezes actual SDK requests/schemas/maps/dependency versions/source hashes,
journals attempts before transport and uses an exclusive one-use launch record.
Each boundary permits one send, no retries/tools/redirects; ceilings were six sends,
60 seconds/request, 600 total, 10000 estimated input including schema plus 1024 reserve,
4000 output except official reasoning's existing 1200. Valid unknown identity proposals
remain distinct from malformed reference transport. V0 still returns proposals only.

Preflight rebuilt nine references/fourteen candidate occurrences/twelve distinct
candidates and restored all nine old proposals; original V0 SHA256 was
`b9cf2d4c5ed9b50d2a73e87f93d3631021a0abf7cdea19d1fcc9d5c83d87582b`.
Original 61 hashes and mapping digest above were unchanged. Six uncached capped calls
estimated USD 0.018 using October 5 Luna Standard USD 0.10 input/0.01 cached/0.50 output
per million; the approved USD 0.05 allowance was a retail estimate, not an invoice cap.

| Offline stage | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Initial executor | 18 focused passed; full 2704 passed, 10 skipped, 246.51 seconds. |
| Independent review | Standards zero; Spec two P2: Repair bypassed `build_repair_input`, primary omitted `validate_output_sources`. |
| Corrected acceptance seams | Production `repair_input_2` and native source/name/date checks;19 focused, 89 executor/Repair, 42 date/source/order tests passed. Both reviews rechecked clear. |
| Final SDK preflight | Six MockTransport sends, zero live. Estimated inputs 3958/1853/4279/3383/1436/6158;581 source files frozen. |
| Later delivery full suite | 2705 passed, 10 skipped, 421.67 seconds; this includes corrected executor, unlike the earlier full gate. |

The fixed review base was `73c5412492438ae89882925ffc25a25700bad4ce`, implementation
`a90dd87fec27b8a1a2b2aa3a3d170fadde0edc03`, correction/frozen live revision
`c9fbd3a49df61f6a458a68ef4e42b7b09ddcf267`. No Python type-check command was configured.

One authorized execution completed six sends in 18.016 seconds, all HTTP200/completed/Luna,
with no baseline call or altered fixture. The five planner fixtures were synthetic;
the identity fixture reused the frozen real V0 candidate packet without acquisition.

| Boundary | Selected native check | Input / output tokens | Retail estimate USD |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Shared V1-V3 primary | Two restored places; source/date/coverage acceptance | 2,508 / 362 | 0.0004318 |
| Review profile | Restored place; two-review ownership | 611 / 131 | 0.0001266 |
| V3 Repair | Restored activity/place/target; isolated `apply_patch` permissions | 2,815 / 154 | 0.0003585 |
| Official reasoning | Restored source/place; exact supplied URL/span alignment | 1,863 / 322 | 0.0003473 |
| Product introduction | Two restored activity keys; ownership and coverage | 279 / 64 | 0.0000599 |
| V0 identity | Nine unique reference proposals; per-reference candidate bounds | 4,756 / 571 | 0.0007611 |

Totals: 12832 input, 1604 output, 14436 overall, zero cached and 211 reasoning tokens
already included in output. Raw usage also reported11930 cache-write tokens.
The October 5 [Luna Standard basis](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-6-luna)
gives USD 0.0020852 before separately priced cache-write/regional/invoice adjustments;
actual billing is unavailable. All nine `(reference_id,decision,candidate_id)` associations
matched the old pilot; different prose and structural agreement do not prove identity truth.

Independent offline `build_cost_report` reproduced six costs and classified linked HTTP
as transport-only. A source-hash-bound derived `oracle` envelope supplied run identity/time;
no cost was allocated to planner versions. Complete-run/invoice coverage remained unknown.
Evidence: `artifacts/short-id-live-20261005/packet/`, its `live/` canonical outputs,
attempts/usage/raw responses, and containing owner assessment/derived cost artifacts.
Original raw responses, six request/response hashes and source/V0 bindings were verified.

The later authorized publication checkpoint is [PR #68](https://github.com/rplalala/Reliable-Trip-Plan-Agent/pull/68),
base `62f9329903b53f76abb8ea2a37e119bd94d3f478`, initial head
`a802724ce5040ac3897428d207ca2fd3ac52fecb`. Eight release files passed both reviews;
no hosted CI workflow was configured, so local checks formed the recorded gate.
The checkpoint did not yet assert merge/closure; PR/Issue retain definitive state.

Six selected samples had no new restoration failure. They establish neither general
error rate nor full orchestration, venue-policy truth, prose accuracy or a benchmark.
Native identity adoption was still zero, four V0 routes UNKNOWN, and #67 Proposed.
Short references reduce long-ID copying exposure without eliminating semantic errors.
