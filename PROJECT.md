# Capstone Project Context

Current source of truth. Updated 2026-10-09.
Detailed design, development and acceptance records are indexed in
[docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## 1. Purpose and responsibility

This Capstone / Thesis B project builds an LLM-based travel planner for feasible
and reliable itinerary generation. It maintains four independently runnable
versions so their mechanisms remain distinguishable.

Current work covers system design, implementation, engineering validation and
approved RTPEval implementation. Formal benchmark construction/execution,
version-comparison experiments, thesis writing and final research conclusions
require separate authorization. Development smoke results are bounded evidence,
not general quality rankings or automatic version freezes.

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and its linked policies own collaboration, language, approval,
Git and archive rules; detailed rules are loaded for the relevant operation.
Repository content is English; user-facing development discussion is Chinese.

## 2. Architecture and version boundaries

Use a modular monolith: React frontend; FastAPI API/application/backend services;
shared LLM, evidence, RAG and orchestration components with version-specific
entry points; PostgreSQL + pgvector for TripWorld retrieval.
External provider payloads are normalized before entering application policies.

| Version | Implemented mechanism | Independent entry point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V0 | Plain LLM with shared input interpretation; model-estimated transport and optional model-knowledge references | `scripts/run_v0.py` |
| V1 | External place, weather, route and supported official/current evidence; shared candidate supply and post-primary Nearby | `scripts/run_v1.py` |
| V2 | V1 plus bounded TripWorld RAG discovery, Google identity resolution and canonical merge | `scripts/run_v2.py` |
| V3 | V2 plus structured validation, authorized targeted Repair and re-validation | `scripts/run_v3.py` |

V1-V3 share the tools-generation pipeline; V3 adds its own post-primary extension.
Shared correctness fixes must preserve the intended behavior of dependent versions.
Supplied model identities now use request-local short references at the affected
provider boundaries, with exact restoration before existing domain/ownership checks;
see the [identity transport contract](docs/0001-system-architecture.md#model-identity-references).
Earlier milestone freezes retain their original scope; later changes are separately
recorded and do not automatically re-freeze any version.

Product UI/API uses V3 and an allowlisted presentation contract. Developer mode
exposes V0-V3 independently. Current input assistance includes destination suggestions,
currency/date controls and optional user-reviewed preference polishing.

Details: [shared architecture](docs/0001-system-architecture.md),
[frontend design](docs/0007-application-operations.md), and the
[version design index](docs/README.md#core-designs).

## 3. Current behavioral contracts

### Requirements and candidate supply

- `planning_request_2` supplies destination, supported dates, traveler count,
  whole-trip budget/currency and optional additional preferences.
- Nonempty preferences use one shared interpretation stage; empty preferences
  skip that model call. Application-owned requirements retain exact source and
  subject provenance. Unsupported hard conditions and unresolved required identities
  preserve clarification boundaries.
- Ordinary positive POI interests use soft targets of one distinct qualifying POI,
  or two for an explicitly sourced trip focus. Explicit counts, dates, exclusions
  and exclusive restrictions take priority. Broad enjoyment does not invent quotas.
- V1-V3 use bounded discovery, evidence acquisition, semantic assessment and
  deterministic candidate supply. Shared landmark opportunities remain available
  after preference targets are met. Candidate opportunity is not final fulfillment.
- V2/V3 use the existing TripWorld exact geographic retrieval and canonical merge;
  no new vector rebuild, ANN index or alternate persistence layer is implied.

Details: [requirements](docs/0002-requirements-evidence.md),
[POI supply](docs/0002-requirements-evidence.md),
[landmark discovery](docs/0002-requirements-evidence.md), and
[V2 retrieval](docs/0004-retrieval-persistence%28v2v3%29.md).

### Itinerary, transport and Repair

- The shared output is `itinerary_2`. Primary visits and optional unscheduled Nearby
  references stay separate. References do not satisfy required visits or count as
  scheduled activities or planned costs.
- V0 generates explicitly estimated transport activities without Routes calls.
  New output includes structured mode and directed activity endpoints; absent/null
  declarations remain compatible with historical outputs. These are model estimates.
- V1-V3 model output must not contain transport activities. Their primary DTO and
  shared output acceptance enforce the declared-role boundary; prompts also prohibit
  disguised transport. Application-owned `transfers` use Routes evidence. Models may
  use supplied route evidence to leave suitable gaps between visits.
- A forbidden declared transport activity fails generation without automatic deletion
  or an extra retry. Comprehensive semantic detection of disguised prose is not claimed.
- V3 uses bounded, permissioned patches and re-validates proposed/adopted results.
  It preserves prior accepted improvements when later attempts fail. No unsupported
  evidence is manufactured to turn UNKNOWN into PASS.
- Minimum daily coverage and optional quantity review are distinct. Sparse/overfull
  days do not automatically authorize arbitrary changes; review flags and permissions
  are recorded per run.

Details: [shared output](docs/0003-itinerary-transport.md),
[minimum coverage](docs/0003-itinerary-transport.md),
[V3 current design](docs/0005-validation-repair%28v3%29.md), and
[transport correction acceptance](docs/records/evaluation/intake-identity-usage.md#rtpeval-transport-correction-acceptance).

## 4. RTPEval implementation status

RTPEval runs independently over source-linked submitted outputs. Planner validation,
internal findings and caches are not independent factual ground truth. The operational
`evaluation_run_cli prepare / execute / replay` flow captures independent evidence,
records actual requests/usage and produces native automatic reports for V0-V3 finals.

| Capability | Current behavior | Detailed owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Intake and identity | Original claims, source hashes and version-owned targets; V0 model correspondence, V1-V3 independent API/program checks without evaluator-model fallback | [Intake/identity/usage](docs/contracts/0002-intake-identity-usage.md) |
| Evidence and accounting | Frozen Search/Details/Matrix snapshots, failure receipts, source-linked coordinates, actual usage and explicit retail estimates when billing is unavailable | [Artifacts](docs/contracts/0001-evaluation-artifacts.md), [usage](docs/contracts/0002-intake-identity-usage.md#offline-cost-accounting) |
| Requirements and schedule | Explicit counts/dates/exclusions/fixed times; verified occurrence associations with separate grounding; V0 declared transport occupancy and V1-V3 transfers | [Requirements/schedule](docs/contracts/0003-requirement-schedule.md) |
| Opening | Applicable current facts take precedence; valid regular hours decide unresolved intervals; query-time openNow and special markers alone do not prove visit closure | [Opening/routes](docs/contracts/0004-opening-routes.md#opening) |
| Routes | Independent coordinates and mode/time-applicable route evidence against original reserved duration; unsupported provider scope remains unresolved | [Opening/routes](docs/contracts/0004-opening-routes.md#route-wire) |
| Quality and density | Five automatic dimensions with separate evidence availability; source-linked pace deductions adjust the final total without adding hard generation quotas | [Quality/density](docs/contracts/0005-quality-human-review.md) |
| Additional evaluation tracks | Blinded review, V3 paired reports, controlled Repair and mechanism/official-claim audit interfaces are implemented; their execution and research populations require their own scope | [Evaluation design](docs/0006-independent-evaluation.md), [artifacts](docs/contracts/0001-evaluation-artifacts.md) |

Current identity policies are `versioned_api_identity_3` and
`v0_identity_correspondence_3`; requirement/schedule rules are version 3 and opening
rules are version 2. Verified physical associations can support occurrence matching,
opening and route checks while original grounding FAILs remain visible. Requirement
targets belong to their own version. Historical reports retain their original policies,
code and source bindings; a rule change produces a separate recalculation.

The latest Sydney engineering case has four original outputs, reviewed requirements,
fresh independent evidence and a completed native evaluator flow. V2/V3 generation
includes captured embedding/SQL retrieval; V3 exercised Repair. Zero-network replay
preserves all originals and the original execution receipt. Under current recalculated
rules, results are:

| Version | Overall score | Opening UNKNOWN | Grounding FAIL |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| V0 | 89.2857 | 2 | 0 |
| V1 | 68.0000 | 4 | 2 |
| V2 | 75.0000 | 4 | 0 |
| V3 | 81.1111 | 4 | 0 |

The hard Opera House exact-once obligation is PASS for all four outputs. Fourteen
opening checks lack both current and regular hours; successful HTTP acquisition does
not supply those missing facts. V1's two literal address FAILs reflect API abbreviations.
Six density FAILs are auxiliary soft pace penalties. Powerhouse's undated temporary
closure is retained without proving access on the planned date. This one engineering
case establishes runnable integration, not a formal ranking or version freeze.

Evidence: [generation and host resumption](docs/records/v0-v3/development-pilots.md#sydney-generation-host-resumption-2026-10-08),
[fresh evaluator acceptance](docs/records/evaluation/intake-identity-usage.md#sydney-four-final-fresh-acceptance-2026-10-09),
[requirement correction](docs/records/evaluation/intake-identity-usage.md#requirement-physical-association-correction-2026-10-09),
and [opening fallback acceptance](docs/records/evaluation/opening.md#regular-opening-fallback-acceptance-2026-10-09).
Commands and input preparation: [evaluation package guide](backend/evaluation/README.md).

## 5. Configuration, evidence and limitations

`config/runtime.yaml` and typed runtime configuration own active limits;
[config reference](config/README.md) explains them. Entry-point deadlines and stage
budgets are distinct. Dated execution allowances do not become runtime defaults.
[Development guide](docs/guides/development.md) owns runnable commands.

Latest full backend validation: **3124 passed, 10 skipped** on 2026-10-09
for the opening fallback correction; the public scorer/CLI gate passes **96**.
Standards and Spec reviews each found zero issues.
The latest recorded frontend gate is **98 passed**, with TypeScript, build and lint
passing; this backend task does not rerun or imply new frontend validation.
Actual failure/correction/retest sequences belong in the linked acceptance records.

Remaining limitations:

- Missing opening/access facts, unsupported route-provider scopes and unresolved
  identity/time/role evidence remain visible. A complete process can contain UNKNOWN.
- V0 semantic correspondence is fallible. V1-V3 literal name/address grounding can
  reject abbreviations even when physical association is verified.
- Undated business status does not establish future closure dates. Exterior/public-area
  access and an official-evidence fallback are not implemented by the opening correction.
- The retained KR V0 route package has unresolved provider/departure support. Proposed
  alternate providers need an approved adapter/evidence scope; Sydney acceptance does
  not resolve those historical legs. See [route support](docs/records/evaluation/routes.md#kr-route-support-budget-2026-10-07).
- Provider invoices and some billed quantities are unavailable; explicit retail/proxy
  estimates are not actual bills. RAG coverage and retrieval performance remain bounded
  by corpus/runtime evidence, not a general availability guarantee.
- Blinded, controlled-Repair and official-audit interfaces exist, but the latest Sydney
  automatic run did not execute those separate tracks or a formal benchmark.

Detailed engineering history is indexed in [records](docs/records/README.md), including
[evaluator records](docs/records/evaluation/intake-identity-usage.md),
[V3 development](docs/records/v0-v3/v3-development.md) and
[shared transport validation](docs/records/v0-v3/transport-responsibility-smoke.md).
Ignored logs, artifacts and thesis notes are local evidence, not project authorities
or guaranteed fresh-clone assets.

## 6. Next work and authorization boundary

The approved offline scope of [opening fallback #89](https://github.com/rplalala/Reliable-Trip-Plan-Agent/issues/89)
is complete: scorer/CLI correction, regression tests, saved-evidence recalculation,
review and local documentation/commits. No new provider calls are authorized.
Earlier one-use generation/evaluator allowances are consumed.

After acceptance, the remaining opening facts require a separately scoped evidence
plan if further resolution is wanted. Public-area intent, business-status policy,
address equivalence and formal research are distinct follow-ups. Completion grants
no new execution, freeze, push, PR, merge or branch-switch authority.
GitHub Issues own specifications and live task state; earlier approvals and deliveries
remain in their dated records rather than a chronological status diary here.

## 7. Keeping this file current

Maintain current capability, version boundaries, latest validation, unresolved limits
and authorized next work in place. Keep one current validation checkpoint, with explicit
scope and date. Put request counts, cost inventories, commit diaries, approval sequences
and failure/correction/retest details in their existing dated record owners, then link
them from the relevant current topic. Do not append each completed task to this file.
Historical records and previous PROJECT revisions do not override current scope or
renew execution authority. Use [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for detailed navigation.
